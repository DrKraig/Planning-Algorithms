<h1>Project 2 - Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm with Animation!</h1>

  <h2>Pre-requisites to run the code:</h2>

    1. Python 3 should be installed on your system.
    2. PyGame - Install it using 'pip install pygame'

  <h2>Instructions to run the code:</h2>
  
    1. Clone the repository by clicking the big green button located here: https://github.com/SamPusegaonkar/ENPM661
    2. Open command prompt or terminal.
    3. Navigate to this directory using 'cd ENPM661/Project2'
    4. If OS is windows, type 'python Dijkstra.py'
    4. If OS is Ubuntu, type 'python3 Dijkstra.py'
    5. Input the co-ordinates for starting & ending point
    6. Enjoy!


## A few instresting things about this prorgam.
  1. For each and every node, its co-ordinates, neighbours, parent and the distance to reach that node is being stored.
  2. For each node a parent node has been created so that once the final state is found, a solution could be backtracked.
